title: "Workshops"

Over these three days we'll cover six sessions of content:

| Session | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [The Fundamentals](./1%20-%20Fundamentals.qmd) | The basics of Python. Variables, functions and modules.
| [Data processing](./2%20-%20Data%20processing.qmd) | Importing, manipulating and analysing data with `pandas` |
| [Visualisation](./3%20-%20Visualisation.qmd) | Creating visualisations of our data with `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and `plotly`
| [Sharing and Publishing](./4%20-%20Sharing%20and%20Publishing.qmd) | Using GitHub for sharing and version control, as well as quarto for publishing dashboards and websites. |
| [Statistics](./5%20-%20Statistics.qmd) | Descriptive and inferential statistics, with some regressions and hypothesis testing, using `scipy.stats` and `statsmodels` |
| [Programming Essentials](./6%20-%20Programming.qmd) | Python tools everyone should know. Conditionals, loops, functions and importing scripts. |

These content sessions are pretty packed, and we won't have too much time to deviate. That's why we'll also have five project sessions - see [The Project](../project.md) for details. You're welcome to ask lengthier questions and play around there!
